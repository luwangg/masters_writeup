\section{Background}
MeerKAT is a 64-dish radio telescope aimed at being the precursor to the full \gls{ska} radio telescope. At the time of writing, the MeerKAT array is in the process of being deployed in the Northern Cape of South Africa.
MeerKAT is designed to be a highly sensitive telescope, able to detect very weak signals. It will operate over a few bands in the \SI{0.6}{\giga\hertz} to \SI{15}{\giga\hertz} range. The majority of the dishes are concentrated in the core of the array, which is set to cover an area about \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} in diameter.

Like any radio telescope, MeerKAT requires an RF-quiet environment.
The presence of \gls{rfi} on site would interfere with the ability of the telescope to collect data. At the very least, RFI would swamp the weak signals which the telescope is attempting to receive, or  worse, strong RFI could destroy the sensitive amplifiers and digitisers designed to cope only with extremely low power signals.
It is for this reason that the array is being deployed in the Karoo, away from built-up areas and the RF signals that go with such environments.

However, there is always the possibility that RFI will manifest. 
Although all equipment taken to site is tested beforehand for RFI, if equipment malfunctions or is not configured correctly or shielded correctly, RFI may be introduced. Additionally, electrical or electronic systems away from site in nearby towns or farms may inadvertently emit RFI. 
Sources such as communications systems or electronics typically emit well defined narrowband signals, while malfunctioning electronics could emit spark-like discharges producing very short bursts of broadband noise (impulsive RFI).
As such, RFI management systems must be in place to aid in the detection and amelioration of RFI in order to allow the telescope to function optimally. 

In Electronic Warfare, \gls{aoa} is a critical useful parameter in hostile emitter sorting as it cannot be varied by the emitter \cite{center2012electronic}.The purpose of this research is to design a device capable of detecting RFI and performing \gls{aoa} parameter estimation on the detected signals.
The process of estimating the \gls{aoa} of a signal is known as \gls{df}.
Knowing the \gls{aoa} will allow the SKA team to track down where rogue RFI signals are coming from and to silence them.
