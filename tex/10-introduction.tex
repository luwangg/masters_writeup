\section{Background}
MeerKAT is a 64-dish radio telescope, aimed at being the precursor to the full \gls{ska} radio telescope. At the time of writing, the KeerKAT array is in the process of being deployed in the Norther Cape of South Africa.
MeerKAT is designed to be a highly sensitive telescope, able to detect very weak signals. The first phase of MeerKAT will receive L-Band signals, from \SI{1.00}{\giga\hertz} to \SI{1.75}{\giga\hertz}. The majority of the dishes are concentrated in the core of the array, an area about \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} in diameter.

Like any radio telescope, MeerKAT requires a quite an RF-quiet environment.
The presence of \gls{rfi} on site would interfere with the ability of the telescope to do science. At the very least, RFI would swamp the weak signals which the telescope is attempting to receive, or  worse, strong RFI could destroy the sensitive amplifiers and digitisers designed to cope only with extremely low power signals.
It is for this reason that the array is being deployed in the Karoo, well away from built up areas and the RF signals that go along with built up areas. 

However, there is always the possibility that RFI will manifest. 
Although all equipment taken to site is tested for RFI before hand, if equipment malfunctions or is not configured correctly or shielded correctly, RFI may be introduced. Additionally, electrical or electronic systems away from site in nearby towns or farms may inadvertently emit RFI. RFI could come from a wide range of sources. Typical examples are communications systems or electronics which emit a well defined narrow band signal, or alternatively from malfunctioning electronics which could emit spark-like discharges producing very short burst of broadband noise.
As such, RFI management systems must be in place to aid in the detection and amelioration of RFI in order to allow the telescope to function optimally.

The purpose of this research is to design a device capable of detecting RFI and performing \gls{aoa} parameter estimation on the detected signals.
The process of estimating the AoA of a signal is known as \gls{df}.
Knowing the \gls{aoa} will allow the SKA team to track down there the rogue RFI signals is coming from and silence it.
