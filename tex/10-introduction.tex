MeerKAT is a 64-dish radio telescope, aimed at being the precursor to the full \gls{ska} radio telescope. At the time of writing, the KeerKAT array is in the process of being rolled out, with around 6 dishes being operational at present.
The first phase of MeerKAT will receive L-Band signals, from \SI{1.00}{\giga\hertz} to \SI{1.75}{\giga\hertz}. 

Like any radio telescope, MeerKAT requires a quite RF environment in order to be able to operate. 
The presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) \gls{rfi} could interfere with the ability of the telescope to do science, or even destroy the sensitive amplifiers and digitisers designed to cope with only very weak signals.
It is for this reason that the array is being deployed in the Karoo, well away from built up areas and the RF signals that go along with built up areas. 

However, there is always the possibility that RFI will manifest. 
Although all equipment taken to site is tested for RFI before hand, if equipment malfunctions or is not configured correctly or shielded correctly, RFI may be introduced.
As such, RFI management systems must be in place to aid in the detection and amelioration of RFI in order to allow the telescope to function optimally.

The purpose of this research is to design an RFI management system. 
Specifically, a device capable of detecting RFI and performing \gls{aoa} parameter estimation on them. 
The process of estimating the AoA of a \gls{rf} signal is known as \gls{df}.
