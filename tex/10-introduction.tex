MeerKAT is a 64-dish radio telescope, aimed at being the precursor to the full \gls{ska} radio telescope. At the time of writing, the KeerKAT array is in the process of being rolled out, with around 6 dishes being operational at present.
The first phase of MeerKAT will receive L-Band signals, from \SI{1.00}{\giga\hertz} to \SI{1.75}{\giga\hertz}. 

Like any radio telescope, MeerKAT requires a quite RF environment in order to be able to operate. 
The presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) \gls{rfi} could interfere with the ability of the telescope to do science, or even destroy the sensitive amplifiers and digitisers designed to cope with only very weak signals.
It is for this reason that the array is being deployed in the Karoo, well away from built up areas and the RF signals that go along with built up areas. 

However, there is always the possibility that RFI will manifest. 
Although all equipment taken to site is tested for RFI before hand, if equipment malfunctions or is not configured correctly or shielded correctly, RFI may be introduced.
As such, RFI management systems must be in place to aid in the detection and amelioration of RFI in order to allow the telescope to function optimally.

The purpose of this research is to design an RFI management system. 
Specifically, a device capable of detecting RFI and performing \gls{aoa} parameter estimation on them. 
The process of ascertaining the AoA of RF is known as \gls{df}.

\section{User Requirements}

The following user requirements were drawn up by three senior engineers at SKA SA: the Director of Science and Engineering, Prof Justin Jonas, Systems Engineer for Infrastructure, Carel van der Merwe and digital backend DSP specialist, Dr Jason Manley. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A system to perform direction finding of both impulsive and continuous wave (CW) RFI sources is to be designed.
  \item They key deliverables of this project are a software package and a thesis report.
  \item The software package should have the following functions:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item It should take in input from a correlator. This could either be time domain cross correlation for impulsive sources or frequency domain cross correlation for continuous sources. 
      \item It should parse a configuration file which contains information about the array configuration and information about the output from the correlator.
      \item The data from the correlator should be used to ascertain the direction of the detected signals.
      \item The software should be designed to fit into a system which has a 100\% probability of intercept. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The software should have the following user interface features:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The user should connect to it via a web interface.
      \item A streaming waterfall plot of frequency vs amplitude should be displayed to the user to serve as monitoring of the RFI environment.
      \item The user should be able to select a band of interest from the waterfall plot.
      \item The direction finding should then be computed for the signal in that band.
      \item The result of the DF should be presented to the user. An investigation must be done into the best way to present this information to the user.
      \item Where appropriate, additional meta information should be displayed to the user, such as measurement accuracy or signal strength.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The system should be designed to find terrestrial RFI sources.
  \item The system should be designed to be location independent. It could either be deployed to a fixed location or as a mobile device deployed on a vehicle.
  \item This project should be able to interface easily with other systems requiring its data. Specifically, it should be designed to interface with and pass its data on to an allied project which is doing classification of RFI.
  \item The system should be real-time, where real-time is defined as having a latency in the order of a few seconds from receiving signals to displaying results to the user. 
  \item The hardware and software used should be in line with what is used at MeerKAT. This implies the ROACH platform for hardware, Python for back end software and JavaScript for front end software.  
  \item This system must operate in the context of the MeerKAT site, implying the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item In general, the RF environment is sparse. While there will be multiple simultaneous transmitters, it can be assumed there will only be one transmitter in a channel and one source of transients at a given time.
      \item The sources of the emissions will be relatively slow moving, up to the maximum speed of a vehicle on a dirt road; \SI[per-mode=symbol]{60}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Once the software has been completed, its performance on real life data should be quantified in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A prototype-stage 4-element antenna array should be connected to a \SI{400}{\mega\hertz} baseband digitiser and correlator.
      \item The correlator need not be real time for the demonstration.
      \item As the goal of this project is not to develop a hardware system, there is no specific requirement on receiver sensitivity or noise figure. Whatever the best available hardware is should be used for the antennas, front end and digitiser. 
      \item The performance of the hardware used should be analysed. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Mitigation of the effects of performance degradation due to multipath is outside of the scope of this work.

  \item The report produced should contain a theoretical analysis of the performance of the system, as well as an analysis of the performance of the prototype on site with real signals. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements Review}
It is worth noting from the user requirements that the system being designed here will not be immediately applicable to combating RFI at the MeerKAT site. The reason is that as no down converter will be used, the frequency band being digitised by this system will not be the same as the MeerKAT band. It will be up to future work to add a suitable RF front end in order to allow the system to operate in the MeerKAT band of interest. When designing the software and FPGA firmware, this should be kept in mind so that it should be trivial to reconfigure the algorithms for a different RF front end. 

Based on the fact that the emitters will be either stationary or slow moving, it should be acceptable to have integration times in the order of 1 second. 

Other than these two notes, the requirements as stated by the SKA are clear and understood.

\section{Report Outline}
Following this, Chapter 2 will discuss existing literature which will serve as the foundation for the system being designed here. The literature examined will focus on direction finding fundamentals and a comparison of algorithms to aid the selection of a suitable DF system for this research. It will examine DF for both continuous narrow band signals and impulsive signals. It will explore detection algorithms for impulsive sources, as well as calibration techniques and error calculations.
