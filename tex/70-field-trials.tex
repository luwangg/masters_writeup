In order to test the operation of the complete system, it was necessary to conduct field trials where the DF system was taken from the lab, made into a portable self-contained unit and tested on real signals in the field. There were two field trials done: the first was done early in the project when the system could only do time domain capture from two channels. The second was at the end of the project with the full four channel time and frequency domain system. The objective of the first field trial was to test the data capturing ability of the ROACH as well as to get samples of what real impulsive RFI looks like. The objective of the second field trial was to test the performance and accuracy of the system.

This Chapter first looks briefly at the results of the first field trial and the implications of the types of impulsive RFI that were capture. It then looks at the full system that was tested at the end of the project, tracking both weak narrow band as well as strong impulsive signals. Additionally some calculations and simulations are done around multipath and wave propagation to decide on suitable dimensions for the field trials.
