For weak, narrow band, continuous signals.

\section{Antenna Manifolds}
Algorithm for manifold generation.
A 1000 point 4 element manifold takes about half a second to generate.
Rather than regenerating each time, we use memoization where each time a new frequency gets looked at, the manifold is generated and stored in a dictionary. Then when that frequency is looked at again it's not necessary to regenerate.
