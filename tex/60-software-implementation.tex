Software was written in Python to run on a computer which is connected to the ROACH via Ethernet. The software has two broad function: to interact with and provide an abstraction to the FPGA, and to perform angle of arrival estimation based on the received signals and antenna model. This Chapter looks at the structure of the software package and some results indicating it is working as expected.

The code had to be designed in accordance with good object orientated methodologies in order to provide a useful, well defined and easily extendible interface to the various software components which need to interface with one another and with the correlator. As such, there was significant emphasis encapsulating logic into classes which mirrored the physical structure of the correlator and antenna array, in the sense of modularising the key components and writing reusable code.

The main package which containing the array modeling, ROACH interface and AoA estimation is \lstinline{DirectionFinder-backend}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jgowans/directionFinder_backend}}. The structure of the classes in this package is shown as a UML diagram in \Cref{fig:software:df-backend-uml}. The root class, \lstinline{DirectionFinder} is composed of an \lstinline{AntennaArray} and a \lstinline{Correlator}. 

The \lstinline{AntennaArray} is initialised from an array geometry file that has been produced from by the element coordinate calculator discussed in Chapter 3. It is able to return the expected baseline phase shifts or time delays for all antenna pairs at any angle. This is used to get the theoretical array response for a given angle at a specific frequency. Due to the modular structure of the \lstinline{AntennArray} class, it can be used to simulate and provide information about an antenna array with any number of elements in any configuration. This is an example of the general purpose nature of the application which is being developed here.

The \lstinline{Correlator} provides an interface to processed data from the FPGA. It is able to fetch both frequency domain cross correlations from the snapshot blocks as well as time domain snapshots which it gets by reading raw time domain data and doing in-memory time domain cross correlations. The \lstinline{Correlator} also contain a \lstinline{ControlRegister} which abstracts the raw bit or word read/writes necessary to interact with the status and configuration registers. Once again the software has been designed with generality in mind: any number of baselines can be read out, having spectrums with any number of points for arbitrary start/stop frequencies. These are initialisation configuration parameters of the classes providing the abstractions.\\

The application is launched by a Python executable which takes command line arguments defining the IP of the ROACH, the path to the configuration file for the ROACH, the frequency domain start/stop frequencies, the frequency or frequency range which should be monitored for direction finding, impulse setpoint, accumulation length, and an comment string to label the observation which is being made. Once running it will monitor for impulses and continuously DF the narrow band signal. The raw baseline measurements as well as the calculated AoA are printed to the screen as well as written to a log file in a format which can easily be post-processed for plotting. Warnings such as overflow are printed to the screen.\\

The following sections explain how the software goes about ascertaining angle of arrival for time and frequency domain signals.

\section{Summary}
This Chapter has discussed the structure of the direction finding software package, as well as how the angle of arrival estimation calculations were implemented. It started by showing how the class structure mirrors that of the physical system, providing abstractions around antenna array models, FPGA interactions and FPGA data outputs. Emphasis was placed on making the algorithms reconfigurable for any number of inputs or frequency range.

The frequency domain and time domain angle of arrival estimations were both done in a similar way, by correlating the observed baseline time/phase differences with the theoretical time/phase differences for each possible angle of arrival and finding the one which most closely matches. 

Finally, calibration section discussed potential sources of error in the analogue components of the system. It showed how those sources of error were measured and made available to the direction finding code so that they could be subtracted out to provide a more accurate calibrated measurement of the real signals.
