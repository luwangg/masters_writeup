\section{Antenna Array}

Thoughts on what could go here:
- preface: we will be comparing array configurations, but bearing in mind that for the purpose of this project we're limited to 4 elements.
- we want something close to circular as that provides the best \SI{360}{\degree} coverage.
- 4 element circular has bad performance (will be shown later in comparison). solution: deform.
- deformation done somewhat arbitrarily. Limited by mounting infrastructure. Tried three of four options and selected the best performing one. There is certainly more scope for a study on the tradeoff of deformation vs equal angle performance. For now just wanted something that doesn't suffer from ambiguity too much.
- show multi-colour vis vs df error graph
- show individual fixed source plots
- show fixed freq 4 vs 4 deformed plots
- link to appendix for individually samples plots.
