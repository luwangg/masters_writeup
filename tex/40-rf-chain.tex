This chapter details the design and characterisation of the chain of antenna, low noise amplifier (LNA), lower pass filters and cabling. The cabling is important as each RF chain needs to have exactly\footnote{Some phase difference between the RF chains can and will be calibrated out, but the calibration routine is most robust when the RF chain phases are already closely matches} the same phase delay.
