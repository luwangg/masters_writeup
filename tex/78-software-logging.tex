\section{Logging Infrastructure}
Logging important in application of this size with multiple packages and a large object tree.
Also logging will need to be made avaialbe to web user interface later so must be well structured to integrate with web app.
Python has excellent logging facilities. Allowing logger objects to be hierarchical tree structure like objects created.
Eg: direiction finder creates correlator creates multiple correlation objects create multiple snapshot objects which interact with the FPGA. 
We want to know where a log message comes from. If a snap block reports a message, which snap block?

Different log levels: typical end user may only want critical. For initial setup maybe info. For dev: debug. 

Here, show terminal snapshot of log. Probably snap being read. Show colors. Show critical. FFT overflow?
