\section{Report Outline}
Following this, \cref{ch:lit-review} will discuss existing literature which will serve as the foundation for the system being designed here. The literature examined will focus on direction finding fundamentals and a comparison of algorithms to aid the selection of a suitable DF system for this research. It will examine DF for both continuous narrow band signals and impulsive signals. It will explore detection algorithms for impulsive sources, as well as calibration techniques and error calculations.

\Cref{ch:system-design} contains the high level system design, showing what blocks need to be designed and how they will be linked together in order to build a complete system.

\Cref{ch:simulations} develops some simulation techniques and shows the results of the simulations based on the design discussions in Chapter x

\Cref{ch:rf-front-end} is a brief chapter, detailing the implementation of the basic RF front end. And results of this.

\Cref{ch:firmware-design} discusses the implementation of the FPGA firmware to do data acquisition and the first stage of DSP. And results of this.

\Cref{ch:software-design} details the implementation of the PC code for the direction finding algorithms. And results of this.

\Cref{ch:user-interface} details implementing the user interface for controlling the instrument and viewing its output.

\Cref{ch:field-trials} details field trials of the instrument and the results of the trials.

\Cref{ch:conclusions} contains conclusions and further work.
