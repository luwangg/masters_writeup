\section{Summary}
This chapter has looked at the results obtained from two field trials. The first trial at the SKA reserve captured real impulses and showed that there was no similarity between different types of impulse, hence power detection should be used.

The second trial of the complete system showed it performed well at tracking narrow band signals, even weak ones in the presence of other signals. The tracking of impulses was shown to be acceptable after the data had been cleaned up, despite the hostile environment.
