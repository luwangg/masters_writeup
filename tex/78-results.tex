\section{Summary}
This chapter has looked at the results obtained from two field trials. The first trial at the SKA reserve captured real impulses and showed that since there was no similarity between different types of impulsive signals, power detection should be used in time-domain capture. The second trial was of the complete system at the UCT sports field. The trial showed that the DF system performed well at tracking narrow band signals, even weak ones in the presence of other signals. The tracking of impulsive signals was shown to be acceptable after a cleaning up of the data which was necessitated by the environment being noisy.
