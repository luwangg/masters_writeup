\chapter{Review of Current Direction Finding Systems}

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a discussiong into current strategies and implementations of direction finding systems. An analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems will take place which will aid in the later descision of which strategy to adopt for this project

\section{Antenna Array Fundamentals}
Here should be a discussion about how why arrays are necessary for DF. Then a discussion about some of the characteristics of an array.
\subsection{Array Manifold}
As discussed in \cite{sleiman2000antenna}, and array manifold is: fuck knows.

\section{Overview of Direction Finding}
A broad look at the DF techniques which exist. The most applicable of these will be examined in more details following.
Classical methods of direction finding algorithms \cite{tuncer2009classical}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Beamforming: by introducing the correct phase delay to each channel of the array, the array factor can be made to be such that the signal in quesetion is added coherently by each element of the array.
		This phase delay indicates the direction of arrival of the signal. The coherent addition of the signals allows for much higher SNR. 
\end{itemize}
