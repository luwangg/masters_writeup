\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:lit-review}
In this chapter an exploration of the current literature around direction finding is undertaken.
It will first cover an overview of the fundamentals of antenna arrays and signals in order to establish the concepts, terminology and mathematics required to understand specific DF techniques. 
Next, a variety of DF techniques will be analysed. The algorithm and principal of each technique will be presented, followed by the advantages and disadvantages of the technique. 
These advantages/disadvantages will be tied back to the user requirements defined in \Cref{ch:introduction} to ascertain whether the technique is appropriate for this application. Where possible, existing systems which implement a particular technique will be cited as examples.

The purpose of this chapter is to gain sufficient information about the various DF techniques to make informed system design decisions in \Cref{ch:system-design}, as well as to implement accurate simulations.
