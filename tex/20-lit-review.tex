\chapter{Literature Review}

As discussed by (Electronic warfare and radar systems engineering handbook), in Electronic Warfare, AoA is the most critical parameter in hostile emitter sorting as it cannot be varied from pulse to pulse by the emitter. This may not directly translate to RFI hunting as emitters are not intentionally being hostile, but the RFI sources are still constrained in that their AoA parameter cannot be altered and hence is useful. 

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a discussion into current strategies and implementations of direction finding systems. An analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems will take place which will aid in the later descision of which strategy to adopt for this project
